# How to Build Go Apps

To build Go apps, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Go is installed: `go version`

2. Set up your GOPATH if you have not done so already and set your environment variables accordingly.

3. Navigate to the desired directory where the source code is found: `cd /Users/lin/terraform-provider-klayer`

4. Build the app: `go build -o output-name main.go`

5. Run the app: `./output-name`

6. If necessary, install dependencies using `go get -u github.com/user/repo`

7. Verify the app runs correctly after changes by repeating the build and run steps.
